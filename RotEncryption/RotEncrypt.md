# RotEncryption
This program encrypts and decrypts a string using a ROT encryption.
The most popular form of a Rot Encryption is known as a Caesar Cipher, which has a ROT of 13 (half of the alphabet). This program will take any form of ROT encyrption "n" and a sentence with mixed case. When encrypting, each of the letters in the sentence will move along the alphabet n times. A ROT encryption/decryption of 26 will appear to do nothing since the letters will move along the alphabet 26 times, returning them to their original position.
